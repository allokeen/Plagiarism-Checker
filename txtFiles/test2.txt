White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Who will dance on the floor in the round
Think you're so criminal
Bruises, on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
